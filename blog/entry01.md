# Entry 1 Deciding my Topic(Interior Design)
##### 10/23/2023
## Choosing a topic
The topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is interior design. Interior designs make indoor spaces functional, safe, and beautiful by determining space requirements and selecting essential and decorative items, such as colors, lighting, and materials I decided on this topic because I've always enjoyed making indoor space useful, safe, and beautiful. As a kid, I always loved to play games about indoor design. And I always liked to make my room a safe, organized environment. I considered making this project about fashion or graphic design but I found interior design more interesting.

The main links I used to research interior designs were [What is Interior Design?](https://www.nysid.edu/academics/what-is-interior-design) and [A Typical Day in the Life of an Interior Designer](https://interiordesignedu.org/day-in-the-life-of-an-interior-designer/). The first link helped me understand what interior design is about. The second link helped me see a day in the life of an interior designer and skills for the field. 
## Engineering Design Process 
I am currently in steps 1 and 2 of the engineering design process, where the goal is to define and research. At first, we were defining what we are most passionate about. Then, we will research more about technology in the field of interior design. For example, interior designers build powerful-looking 3D models and even 3D printing using technology. This allows people to readily picture a room or environment without physically creating it. After we finish researching the next step is brainstorming possible solutions.
## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **consideration,** and **how to google**
### Consideration
One skill that I learned during this experience is consideration. While deciding my topic I had 3 different fields that I liked interior design, fashion, and graphic design. So I had to consider the impact of each topic, and my interests. I used consideration to decide that interior design is important in impacting people's everyday lives.
### How to Google 
Another skill that I learned during this experience is How to Google. During my research about interior design, many articles were showing up in Google. To find the articles that were right for me I had to look at the titles. And to get information on interior design technology it was helpful to google "technology in interior design."
## Summary
To conclude, I am really excited to continue working on this project. And my next step is to brainstorm possible solutions.
